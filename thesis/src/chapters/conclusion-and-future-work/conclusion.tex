\mySection{Conclusion}
In this thesis, we have proposed a roll call system using Deep Metric Learning and k-NN classification.
The system enables educational organizations to record students' attendance simply by taking a photo of
the entire classroom, thus saving a huge amount of time for both teachers and students.
We have also evaluated the practicality of our system by examining the accuracy of facial recognition.

Implemented in Python 3.5 and with the help of \emph{virtualenv}, PyRollCall is cross-platform and highly portable,
since all of its dependencies are already packaged with the project. It is implemented with \emph{OpenCV}
for capturing images from a camera, with \emph{face\_recognition} which is a wrapper library of \emph{dlib}
for performing facial recognition with Deep Metric Learning, and with \emph{PyGTK} for designing a user-friendly GUI.

There are two prerequisites which should be fulfilled before using PyRollCall:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The user should enter the data of all students and courses he or she teaches into the system; for each course, select the students that are currently taking it.
  \item Collect approximately 10 to 15 photos from each student and let the system pre-compute their facial embeddings (or encodings).
\end{enumerate}
